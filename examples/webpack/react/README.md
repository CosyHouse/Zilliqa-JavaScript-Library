# React Webpack Example

This example will demonstrate how to use the webpack variant of ZilliqaJS in a React project. This react project is created using `create-react-app`.

This project would perform the following:
- add a default wallet to a Zilliqa object
- query the wallet and its balance
- send a transaction of 1 ZIL from the wallet to another wallet

## Execution
```
cd to examples/webpack/react folder
yarn
yarn start
```

**Note**
If you are using a frontend framework such as React or Vue, we strongly recommend you to use our node version instead of the webpack variant as the schematic is easier to work with.
